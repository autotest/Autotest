To generate data:

./parse <data directory>

This should create "tko_db"

SOME THINGS ARE STILL HACKY ^W IN DEVELOPMENT

There are two separate sets of code. The backend creates the database.
parse, parse.py

The frontend parses the data for display: display.py, frontend.py, *.cgi

db.py is shared.
