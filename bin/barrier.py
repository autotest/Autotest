class barrier:
	""" Multi-machine barrier support

	Provides multi-machine barrier mechanism.  Execution
	stopping until all members arrive at the barrier.

	When a barrier is forming the master node (first in sort
	order) in the set accepts connections from each member
	of the set.	As they arrive they indicate the barrier
	they are joining and their identifier (their hostname
	or IP address and optional tag).  They are then asked
	to wait.  When all members are present the master node
	then checks that each member is still responding via a
	ping/pong exchange.	If this is successful then everyone
	has checked in at the barrier.  We then tell everyone
	they may continue via a rlse message.

	Where the master is not the first to reach the barrier
	the client connects will fail.  Client will retry until
	they either succeed in connecting to master or the overal
	timeout is exceeded.

	As an example here is the exchange for a three node
	barrier called 'TAG'

	  MASTER                        CLIENT1         CLIENT2
	    <-------------TAG C1-------------
	    --------------wait-------------->
	                  [...]
	    <-------------TAG C2-----------------------------
	    --------------wait------------------------------>
	                  [...]
	    --------------ping-------------->
	    <-------------pong---------------
	    --------------ping------------------------------>
	    <-------------pong-------------------------------
	            ----- BARRIER conditions MET -----
	    --------------rlse-------------->
	    --------------rlse------------------------------>

	Note that once the last client has responded to pong the
	barrier is implicitly deemed satisifed, they have all
	acknowledged their presence.  If we fail to send any
	of the rlse messages the barrier is still a success,
	the failed host has effectively broken 'right at the
	beginning' of the post barrier execution window.

	For example:
	    if ME == SERVER:
	        server start

	    b = job.barrier(ME, 'server-up', 120)
	    b.rendevous(CLIENT, SERVER)

	    if ME == CLIENT:
	        client run

	    b = job.barrier(ME, 'test-complete', 3600)
	    b.rendevous(CLIENT, SERVER)

	    if ME == SERVER:
	        server stop
