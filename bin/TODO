Make sure build process dumps config errors in separate file from build
errors (and warnings), from build output

Make test wrapper chdir before and after setup and execute phases - nappy change

Fix lmbench's config stage stuff

Redirect stdout and stderr for each test's setup and execute to 4 sep files

   the loss of chronology is bad IMHO)

make profilers/cat take either a single file or list of files, autoswitching

Caching version of kernelexpand to grab new kernels

Add local libaio to fsx

python script to see what I mean) ... generates a file in results/debug/debug,
but doesn't cascade up
