For the impatient:

Execute the get_started.py script located on this directory,
that will guide you through setting up the default libvirt test
scenario:

 * Guest install with Fedora 15
 * Boot, reboot and shutdown test

The script will help you to create all the directories, and
even get the OS iso in case you don't have it yet.
