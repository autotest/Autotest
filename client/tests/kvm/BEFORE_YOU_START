Install kvm and load modules.
Remove 'env' file if exists.
Remove control.state file if exists.

Copy kvm_tests.cfg.sample into kvm_tests.cfg
Modify kvm_tests.cfg to your liking.
Modify control if you prefer to "use your own kvm" (comment out kvm_install).

Create those symbolic links under kvm_runtest_2 or under <rootdir>
qemu                   -> qemu-kvm binary (unless using kvm_install)
qemu-img               -> qemu-img binary (unless using kvm_install)
isos/                  -> isos (mount or symlink)
images/                -> images (mount or symlink)
autotest/              -> ../../ (an autotest client directroy)
steps_data/            -> steps_data dir (when available)

Please make sure qemu points to an "installed" kvm-qemu executable, and
not one just compiled in the source directory. An installed executable "knows"
where to find its associated data-dir (e.g. for bios).
