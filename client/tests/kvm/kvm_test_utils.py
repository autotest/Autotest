"""
High-level KVM test utility functions.

This module is meant to reduce code size by performing common test procedures.
Generally, code here should look like test code.
More specifically:
    - Functions in this module should raise exceptions if things go wrong
      (unlike functions in kvm_utils.py and kvm_vm.py which report failure via
      their returned values).
    - Functions in this module may use logging.info(), in addition to
      logging.debug() and logging.error(), to log messages the user may be
      interested in (unlike kvm_utils.py and kvm_vm.py which use
      logging.debug() for anything that isn't an error).
    - Functions in this module typically use functions and classes from
      lower-level modules (e.g. kvm_utils.py, kvm_vm.py, kvm_subprocess.py).
    - Functions in this module should not be used by lower-level modules.
    - Functions in this module should be used in the right context.
      For example, a function should not be used where it may display
      misleading or inaccurate info or debug messages.
